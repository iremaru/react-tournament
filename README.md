## 🟠🤷🏻‍♀️Why (´･ω･`)?

This project started as a simple programming exercise proposed by Brais Moure on the programming challenge website.

Since it was only expected to create the logic and track the program through console logs, it didn't have much complexity. However, when I decided to use TypeScript and React to solve it, I couldn’t resist giving it a user interface. That meant working on the aesthetics. And since I was dedicating time to creating character selection cards or displaying the upcoming rounds, I also decided to show how the combat unfolded.

The exercise ended up becoming a more complex project, but also much more fun to develop.

## 🟠🕹️How to use ╰(*°▽°*)╯

1. Select the contenders you want from the participants table. Remember that a tournament can only take place if the number of participants is a power of 2.
2. In the section immediately below the participants table, you can see how many rounds will be played and the scheduled matches for the first round, or whichever round is about to start.
3. Press the play button to start the first match.
4. At any moment during the match, you can press the pause button to stop it.
5. During the match, a history of the moves made by each fighter and their outcomes will be displayed.
6. If you have autoplay enabled, the next match will start automatically once the current one is over. Otherwise, you will have to press the play button again.
7. At the end of each round, the defeated combatants will be shown, and they will be eliminated from the competition. Press play to start the next round.
